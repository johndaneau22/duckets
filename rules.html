    <h2 id="Ownership">A. Ownership</h2>
    <p>The league will consist of 12 teams and each team can only have 1 owner. The team owner has ownership of his team
        as long as he continues to pay the league dues each year and does not mess with the integrity of the league.
    </p>
    <h3 id="New Owners">A.1 New Owners</h3>
    <p>When a spot opens up in the league for a new owner, the person highest on the league waitlist will have the first
        claim to the open team. The commissioner will keep track of the current waitlist. Because of the large number of
        people already on the current waitlist, no new names will be added to the waitlist until the waitlist is
        completely exhausted.</p>
    <P>New owners will not be eligible for keepers in their first year. They will receive the minimum number of lottery
        balls for the draft lottery of their first year. </P>
    <p>New owners will not inherit any of the pick trading obligations done from their team during the previous season.
        The trades existing owners made with teams that now have new owners will be honored in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If an existing owner is owed a draft pick from a team who now has a new owner, the existing owner will
            receive a compensatory pick. The compensatory pick will take place after the last pick of the round in which
            the existing owner was due the pick. To make up for the extra pick, the owner who received the compensatory
            pick will lose a pick in the lowest round in which they have a pick available. </li><br>
        <li>If an existing owner owes a draft pick to a team with a new owner, the existing owner will still forfeit
            their pick during the round. To make up for the loss of the pick, the owner will receive a compensatory pick
            after the last round of the draft. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Current Waitlist Order:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Tom</li>
        <li>Duga</li>
        <li>Pierre</li>
        <li>Gobbi</li>
        <li>Ian</li>
        <li>Jarod</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="Expelling Owners">A.2 Expelling Owners</h3>
    <p>League owners can be voted out of the league if they commit rules violations. Any owners caught cheating or
        colluding with other owners will be subject to dismissal from the league pending league vote. If the alleged
        cheater receives a majority vote in favor of dismissing them from the league, they will forfeit the rights to
        the team and will never be allowed back into the league. </p>
    <br>
    <h2 id="Buy-in and Prize Payouts">B. Buy-in and Prize Payouts</h2>
    <h3>League Buy-in</h3>
    <p>The league buy-in is <b>$200</b> per season. Each owner must pay the buy-in on the day of the draft. If they do
        not have
        the money the day of the draft, they need to work out a plan for making payment to the commissioner. Owners who
        haven’t paid the league buy-in by week 4 will have their teams locked. If the owner doesn’t pay the league
        buy-in by the end of the week 16, they will be automatically dismissed from the league. </p>
    <h3>Payouts</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1st Place: $1150</li>
        <li>2nd Place: $450</li>
        <li>3rd Place: $250</li>
        <li>1st Place (regular season): $100</li>
        <li>Regular Season High PF + PA: $100</li>
        <li>Regular Season High PF: $50</li>
        <li>Weekyly High Points (up to week 14): $25</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="League Settings">C. League Settings</h2>
    <p>We use ESPN.COM to host the Duckets League. The settings we have agreed to for ESPN.COM league is below. Unless
        agreed upon by league vote, ESPN's decisions on scoring, roster elibility, and injury designations will be
        honored. To find the league settings: <a
            href="https://fantasy.espn.com/football/league/settings?leagueId=482271&view=summary">ESPN League Settings

    <h3 id="Transactions">C.4 Transactions</h3>
    <img src=images/Transactions.jpg>
    <p>For trades, each owner involved in a trade should make an effort to alert the league of pending trades using text
        message, email, or Kik chat. If a trade involves a draft pick, the draft picks included should be posted on the
        league message board. </p>
    <p><b>Trade Deadline:</b> The trade deadline is set between Week 11 and Week 12 each year. </p>
    <h3 id="Schedule and Playoffs">C.5 Schedule and Playoffs</h3>
    <img src=images/Schedule.jpg>
    <p><b>Randomizing the Schedule:</b>Each year, ESPN uses the exact same schedule from the year before. In order to
        avoid playing the same teams the same weeks each year, the commissioner resets the schedule prior to the Draft
        Order Lottery taking place.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 id="Keepers">D. Keepers</h2>
    <p>Each returning owner can keep up to 3 players from their roster from the previous year. The player can not have
        been kept or drafted in Rounds 1 or 2 the previous season.</p>
    <h3>Keeper's Round Value</h3>
    <p>Each keeper will cost the owner a pick that is two rounds higher from where the player was drafted, or kept,
        during the previous season’s draft. <b>Example:</b> If a player was drafted, or kept, the previous season in the
        9th
        round, the owner would give up a 7th round pick to keep the player this season.</p>
    <p>If a free agent pickup from the previous season is kept, they will cost the owner a 15th round pick.</p>
    <p>If the owner has traded away their pick for that round, or used it for another keeper or rookie, then they must
        use a pick
        that is higher than the one the player was originally eligible to be kept for. <b>Example:</b> An owner has a
        player
        that is eligible to be kept in the 6th round. However, they traded away their 6th round pick. The owner would
        then need to give up their 5th round pick to keep the player. </p>
    <p>If during the previous season’s draft an owner was forced to use a higher round pick for a keeper because of a
        trade obligation, or another keeper or rookie costing the same round pick, the player costs the owner a pick
        that is 2
        rounds higher than where they COULD HAVE kept the player the previous season. <b>Example:</b> During the
        previous
        season’s draft, an owner has a player that would cost a 10th round pick. However, they’ve traded the 10th round
        pick and are forced to give up a 9th round pick to keep the player. During the current season’s draft, the owner
        wants to keep the player again. Although the player was kept for a 9th round pick the previous season, they were
        eligible to be kept for a 10th. Because of this, this season the player can be kept for an 8th round pick. </p>
    <p>NOTE: It is the commissioner’s responsibility to keep track of players who were kept in rounds that are higher
        than where they were eligible to be kept. </p>
    <h3>Declaring Keepers</h3>
    <p>As the draft date approaches, the commissioner will ask the owners to broadcast who they are planning to keep for
        the upcoming draft. <b>The official deadline to declare keepers is</b> <b>7 days before the draft</b>. The only
        changes
        that would be allowed following the deadline would be if one of your keepers was Injured, Retired, Suspended,
        (I.e. if something else occurred during that week where it looks like your keeper won't be starting Week 1 of
        the NFL season.) </p>
    <br>
    <h2 id="Draft">E. Draft</h2>
    <p>Each year we will hold an in-person draft. The commissioner will poll the league on a date that best fits
        everyone's schedule. In the event an owner can't make the draft, they have the option of appointing and proxy to
        attend the draft in their absence.</p>
    <h3 id="Draft Order">E.1 Draft Order</h3>
    <p>The draft order is determined by a weighted lottery which must take place in front of at least 3 owners and the
        commissioner. </p>
    <p><b>Draft Order Weighting:</b> The number of draft lottery balls a team received is related to their finish during
        the previous season. The distribution of lottery balls is as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Ball: Playoff Champion and Runner-up</li>
        <li>2 Balls: Playoff 3rd and 4th place finishers</li>
        <li>3 Balls: Loser in the first round of playoffs</li>
        <li>4 Balls: Teams that finish 11th and 12th in Regular Season</li>
        <li>5 Balls: Teams that finish 9th and 10th in Regular Season</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Draft Time Clock:</b>Each owner is expected to make their picks within 2 minutes. We will not maintain a stop
        clock unless an owner is consistently going over the allotted 2 minutes. In the event the owner is still going
        over 2 minutes, we will criticize them mercilessly and they need to take shots.
    </p>
    <h3 id="Draft Pick Trading">E.2 Draft Pick Trading</h3>
    <p>Each season an owner can TRADE AWAY one draft pick in rounds 1-3, one in rounds 4-9, and one in rounds 10-17.
    </p>
    <p>Each season an owner can TRADE FOR one draft pick in rounds 1-3, one in rounds 4-9, and one in rounds 10-17.</p>
    <p>In order to ensure teams have 17 players at the end of a draft, an owner who traded away a draft pick will
        receive a compensatory pick. The Compensatory Rounds will take place after round 17. For owners who traded for a
        pick, they will make picks until they have 17 players on their team.
    </p>
    <p><b>Other Draft Notes</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>If an owner has two picks in a round due to trading, they use their own pick first for a keeper or college
            player. </li>
        <li>An owner can not trade for or trade away a pick beyond the immediate next season.</li>
        <li>The Compensatory Rounds begin after Round 17. For any owners that haven't picked 17 players yet, they
            receive picks in the compensatory rounds. The Compensatory Rounds just continue in the same snake fashion
            and order as the normal rounds.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="College Draft">F. College Draft</h2>
    <p><b>Rules:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>After draft we hold an additional one round college draft. This can be done day of or in a text message
            chain the week following the draft.</li><br>
        <li>The College Draft Order is a separate lottery where each owner gets a single ball to determine order.</li>
        <br>
        <li>You can draft any player in college regardless of his class (Fresh, Soph, etc).</li><br>
        <li>We will maintain a list of college players drafted and who owns their rights.</li><br>
        <li>When a college player you have drafted is a rookie, you can keep them for a 10th round pick.</li><br>
        <li>If you have multiple college players become rookies the same year, you can keep all of them.</li><br>
        <li>If you don't have a 10th round pick or are keeping multiple players in the 10th round, you will need to use
            an earlier pick to keep the college player (same as keepers). In this case, we will maintain the college
            player's keeper round value as 10 for the next season and they will be able to be kept for an 8th the
            following season.</li><br>
        <li>When you keep them their rookie years, they would not count against your 3 keeper limit.</li><br>
        <li>After their rookie year, they would become regular keepers in subsequent years and would count against your
            3 keeper limit.</li><br>
        <li>You can't trade College Players rights or the players themselves until after the draft when you keep them.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2 id="Rule Changes and General Purpose Rulings">G. Rule Changes and General Purpose Rulings</h2>
    <h3>Rule Changes</h3>
    <p>If an owner would like to propose a new rule or a change to an existing rule, they must let the commissioner know
        during the offseason and prior to the draft. On draft day, the commissioner will ask the other owners to vote on
        the proposed rule changes prior to the draft beginning. If a majority of the owners vote in favor of the rule
        change, then it is adopted for the upcoming season. </p>
    <h3>General Purpose Rulings</h3>
    <p>Any ruling that needs to be made and is not is not covered in this rulebook should be decided by league vote. In
        the event the league is completely split on the vote, the commissioner will seek the opinion of an objective
        individual from outside of the league. </p>
